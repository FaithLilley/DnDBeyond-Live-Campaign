## 1. Prerequisites

To use this script, you will need a browser extension that allows you to run User Scripts. The two most used are:

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)

Install either TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey for your browser.

## 2. How to Install and Set-up

Install this user script to your browser extension by [clicking on this link](https://github.com/FaithLilley/DnDBeyond-Live-Campaign/raw/master/ddb-live-campaign.user.js) and following the instructions from Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey.

## 3. How to Use

1. Open your [campaigns page on the D&D Beyond website](https://www.dndbeyond.com/my-campaigns).
2. Click on your required campaign.

You'll now see additional information displayed on the card of each character, showing:

- Current Hit Points
- Current Armor Class
- Ability Scores
- Passive Perception / Investigation / Insight
- Resistances

The data is automatically updated every 60 seconds.
